# basic-html-website
This is my first frontend project, built using only HTML. It's a simple multi-page website created to help me understand the basic structure of a website.

The site includes a navigation bar, main content on each page, a footer, and even a basic contact form with fields for name, email, and message. There are separate pages for Home, Projects, Articles, and Contact.

This project is part of my learning journey in frontend development, and it's helping me get comfortable with how websites are organized before I move on to CSS and JavaScript.
